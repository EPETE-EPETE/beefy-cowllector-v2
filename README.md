# üêÆ üßë‚Äçüåæ Cowllector v2 üåæ

This is the bot that harvest all strategies from all Beefy's chains:

**Cowllectors does NOT focus in to be profitable, so don't expect it to win some profit when it harvests. Cowllector harvest script was create it to bring resilience and consistency in all active vaults strategies, giving at least ONE harvest every 24 hour to every strat in every chain**
